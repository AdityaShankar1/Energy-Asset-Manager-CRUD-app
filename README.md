# Energy Asset Manager CRUD App

A system for managing energy asset data, built with **FastAPI** and **Microsoft SQL Server** as the backend, and a **Tkinter desktop client** for demonstrating full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.  
This project showcases integration of enterprise‑grade databases with modern Python APIs, packaged with a simple GUI for interaction.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Backend:** FastAPI with MSSQL for robust CRUD endpoints.
- **Frontend:** Tkinter desktop app for listing, retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting records.
- **Data Model:** Energy product indicators (e.g., crude oil production, stocks, consumption).
- **Architecture:** REST API + GUI client separation.
- **Extensibility:** Can be extended with PySide6, Flet, or web frontends.
